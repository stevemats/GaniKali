GaniKali is a basic movie recommender system. You might be asking, why the name GaniKali? GaniKali is a famous swahili question usually asked after people are bored searching for a good movie to watch(usually after they've spent half an hr going through trailers) and all they're left to do, is holla(call) a friend and ask, "mamacita, movie gani kali kuwatch?" translating, "which movie is dope to watch?"
